##User-table app
In order to run this React web application first of all we need to open the project. After we successfully open the project we need to run the terminal(npm mode). In the terminal the first command will be cd root destination of the project( in my case cd tarikarnaut), after that we type command npm run dev which will compile our project and connect with the localhost server. When we are connected with a localhost server in my case we needed to hold down the ctrl button and click with the mouse pointer on the localhost link. We did all the previous steps and what will happen next is auto opening our internet browser where our web application with UI shows. Now we can see our web application and test features. One of them is sorting the names in the table by clicking with a pointer on the “Name” column and seeing ascending and descending names, the other one is to search by city name in the search box on the left top of the page. Of course there is also a limitation on how many persons will be shown by one page(in our case max 5 persons per one page). If we want to see other persons and details we need to press the page button in the bottom left corner. In the index.tsx is the main code with all functions, hooks, variables while in the globals.css is the code for the style.
